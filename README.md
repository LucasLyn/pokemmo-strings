# How to use
## PC
Simply rename the *strings_en.xml* file in data/strings to *BACKUP - strings_en.xml*, and add my strings file to the folder instead.

## Mobile
Open Client Management, and import the XML file.
To clear, open the menu again, and press the clear button.


# Known bugs
- A dialog box in Hoenn still shows the original text. I have no idea why this happens.
