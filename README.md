## Current version: 1.0
A strings_en file to be used with PokeMMO.


Features;

- Considerably cuts down on healing dialog boxes (Kanto and Hoenn).
- Changes all TV dialogs to "No swarm :(", when a swarm isn't active.
- Cuts down ocarina dialog boxes to be faster.

TO-DO;
- Add Sinnoh and Unova healing dialog boxes.

# How to use
## PC
Simply rename the *strings_en.xml* file in data/strings to *BACKUP - strings_en.xml*, and add my strings file to the folder instead.

## Mobile
Open Client Management, and import the XML file.
To clear, open the menu again, and press the clear button.


# Known bugs
- A dialog box in Hoenn still shows the original text. I have no idea why this happens.
